**Instructions for the execution of codes:**

Please follow the below instructions to run the code.

1. Download the 'SourceCode' and 'functions' folders from the repository.

2. Use 'TestData' in the folder as input data. To create more data, use the codes 'PointSource_Simulation', 'L_shape_Simulation' and 'Square_Shape_Simulation'. The data will be provided upon request.

3. Please note that the source code has the following dependencies:

   k-Wave Toolbox : used for simulating underwater targets

4. Download the k-Wave Toolbox from the URL http://www.k-wave.org/ and the Alpha version of kWaveArray from the URL http://www.k-wave.org/forum/topic/alpha-version-of-kwavearray-off-grid-sources

5. Please ensure that the Number of sensor elements M and N in the 'InputParameters' have been changed according to the data.

6. Run the code.

Please see the articles mentioned in Academic references and Acknowledgements that are to be cited for any usage of the code and/or data.
